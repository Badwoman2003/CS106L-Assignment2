Assignment 3: STL HashMap (short answer questions)
Names:Badwoman
1.at() vs []
the implementation of operator[] allows user to modify the HashMap thats why it should not be overloaded by const
2.Find vs std::Find
the HashMap::Find uses native loop for searching while std::Find uses red-black tree searching,appearently one is O(n) and the other is O(logn)
3.RAII?
when calling ~HashMap() we use clear() which is RAII-compliant
4.Increments
it could be explain by C++ primer:"To solve this problem, the postfix versions take an extra (unused) parameter of type int."
